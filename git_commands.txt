Creating GIT branches happens in only local repository. Creating branches in remote repository happens 
only when publishing an existing local branch.

# To create new local branch from current revision
  $git branch <branch name>
 
# To create new local branch from particular revision
  $git branch <branch name> <revision hash>

# To create remote repository from local branch
  $git push -u origin <local branch name>
  
# To switch to new branch
  $git checkout <branch name>    OR      $git switch <branch name>
 
# To rename exisiting local branch
  $git branch -m <current name> <new name>

# To rename remote repository, we need to delete it and publish the renamed local branch.
  $git push origin --delete <old name>
  
  $git push -u origin <new name>
  
 # To track remote branch
  $git branch --track <local branch> <remote branch>         OR $git checkout --track <base/origin branch>
  
 # To download new commits from remote branch to local branch
  $git pull
  
 # To publish local commits to remote branch
  $git push
  
 # To delete a local branch
  $git branch -d <branch name>
  
 # To merge branches
 # Integrating changes from anther branch into your current local HEAD branch
   $git switch main
   
   $git merge <branch name>
   
# An alternate way to integrate changes from another branch into your current local HEAD branch
   $git rebase main
   
# To compare branches
  $git log <branch1>..<branch2>
